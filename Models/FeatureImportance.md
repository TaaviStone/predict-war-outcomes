# Analysis of Feature Importance in a War Prediction model

![Feature Importance.png](Feature%20Importance.png)

## Introduction
The graph displays the feature importance of a Random Forest Classifier trained to predict the outcome of a war. The features considered in the analysis are:
1. **Surprise**: A surprise attack provides an advantage, and a defender achieving surprise can even the odds.
2. **Terrain**: The type of terrain affects movement and combat capabilities.
3. **Weather**: Extreme weather conditions can influence battle outcomes.
3. **Width of the frontline**: The war of today is a lot different than it  was 200 years ago, where it mattered a lot, who had 
more soldiers and a wider frontline. 

## Graph Insights
The graph highlights the importance of each feature in predicting the outcomes. The order of importance is as follows:
1. **Surprise** : Achieving surprise is a crucial factor indicating a higher likelihood of victory.
2. **Width of frontline** : As said above, in the olden days it mattered a lot how many swords/guns were pointed towards the enemy,
which is why this is as high as it is. In todays world, it doesn't matter as much, because most of the conflicts are not fought by
just pointing small arms against each other.
2. **Weather** : Extreme weather conditions have a moderate impact on battle outcomes.
3. **Terrain** : Favorable terrain provides a significant advantage in battle.

## Feature Impact Analysis
### Surprise
- A surprise attack, especially when the attacker achieves element surprise, significantly increases the chances of victory.

### Terrain
- By the graph, terrain seems to have the least important role after weather and the element of surprise.

### Weather
- Battles fought in extreme weather conditions, such as sandstorms or blizzards, are more likely to result in a draw.

### Width of the frontline
- When the attackers had the bigger frontline, they won more than they lost. In todays world it is not always the case.

## Conclusion
The analysis concludes that surprise is the most influential factor in determining the outcome of a battle. While terrain, weather and width of the frontline also have a significant impact, surprise remains the paramount factor.
